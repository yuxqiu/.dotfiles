## Firefox

1. `user-override.js` should be used in conjunction with `user.js`. I recommend using [arkenfox/user.js](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js).
   - After putting `user.js` into the profile directory, the only thing you need to do is to paste the contents of `user-override.js` into `user.js`.
2. Place `chrome` into the profile directory to enable the theme.
   - Note: this [theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/WhiteSur-firefox-theme?tab=readme-ov-file) is for Linux only. Its homepage has a link to the MacOS and Windows versions of the theme.
